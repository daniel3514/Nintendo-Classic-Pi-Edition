# Nintendo Classic Pi Edition

Raspberry Pi turns our classic Nintendo console into a powerful station retro games

RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi into a retro-gaming machine. It builds upon Raspbian, EmulationStation, RetroArch and many other projects to enable you to play your favourite Arcade, home-console, and classic PC games with the minimum set-up. For power users it also provides a large variety of configuration tools to customise the system as you want.
RetroPie sits on top of a full OS, you can install it on an existing Raspbian, or start with the RetroPie image and add additional software later. It's up to you.
While the RetroPie Project originated at petRockBlock.com this is now the home of RetroPie.
